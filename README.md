# PowerSpel2

PowerSpel, but six years of experience later

In 2017, I created PowerSpel as a means to teach myself the basics of PowerShell. Now, I wanted to give it another go, with six years more experience under my belt.
The game is work in progress, until this readme says otherwise.

## Settings

The game is played at terminal settings of at least 128 characters wide and 57 lines high. Smaller than that will mess up the game. Bigger is possible. but doesn't bring anyting extra.
