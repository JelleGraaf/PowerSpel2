# Contibuting

This is a solo project, but I don't mind contributions. If you want to add to the game, there are two ways of doing so: Adding to the platform or existing games, or adding a new game. Both options are explained below.

## Adding to the platform or existing games

The platform to make the games work, can contain bugs, illogical pieces of code, or it might miss a neat feature. Whatever your suggestion is: just send me a PR and I will take a look at it. The same goes for suggestions or bugfixes to the existing games.

## Adding a game to the platform

If you go really overboard, you can add your own game to the PowerSpel platform. If you choose to do so: great! There are some prerequisites to games and also some tips. You can find them in [Adding-a-game.md](./Docs/Adding-a-game.md).
