Notice that the key appears in your inventory at the top of your screen. All items you pick up go to your inventory and can be used in various ways, that will explain themselves when appropriate. !. Try to open the door to the south of here with your new key. You will find out that it still won't open. Maybe this is not the right key for that door. Move back to the east now and see if you can open that locked door by moving through it.",
