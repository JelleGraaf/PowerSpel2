    "Default": "You walk away from the building, get into your card and drive off. Back at your own office, you write a report with all your findings. You send the findings to the OGD security officer.",
    "Evacuation": "You triggered the evacuation alarm and decide that that marks the end of your assignment. It's not worth it to let the entire building be evacuated. You tap an emergency response officer on the shoulder and explain the situation. With visible disdain, they cancel the evacuation. You are taken to the building manager and security officer, where you have to explain your actions.",
    "Smoke": "The smoke inside the ventilation system quickly spreads through the building. Panic arises, the evacuation alarm goes off and people rush outside. Before you can explain the situation to an emergency response officer, the building has been cleared. The building manager and security officer are obviously not amused and ask for clarification of your actions. After you retrieve your smoke capsule, you are sent away with the message that your superiors will hear from this.",
    "Caught": "You are cought while doing something you weren't allowed to. An alert employee asks you what you are doing and is persistent enough for you to be unable to talk yourself out of it. Together, you walk to the security officer and discuss what you have been up to."
